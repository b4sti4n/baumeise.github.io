# Hardware

Here you'll find some links and suggestions on the hardware you should use for your own Amsel bot. Unfortunately we can't provide a predefined package. Also we can't guarantee the perfect fitting of suggested parts due to changes in the factorying. When you try using it in an university environment or course, we recommend to buy the same parts as your fellow students or try to order together. That'll make it cheaper and the debugging is easier when done in a group.

::: warning
When purchasing other parts than suggested, be aware that you need access and adjust the firmware to fit your board type.

## Microcontroller board
As a board we decided to go with the cheap ESP8266 NodeMCU. It already provides some keyfeatures like onboard wifi and is widely used in all areas of application.

## Motor driver board
For controlling the motors we chose a L298N dual h bridge. we discoverd that this product won't work with an ESP32 board.

## OLED display
For showing information on the robot we chose a economical 0.96" OLED I2C display. The size can also increase in the future years when bigger OLED displays get cheaper.

## Ultrasonic sensor
As a cheap possibility of measuring distance we chose a ultrasonic sensor, which is able to detects a minimal step of 0.3 cm.
